Libraries
=========

Who wants to write a json parser when one already exists? Not this guy.
That's why we're using craigmj/json4lua, which you should have got as a submodule.
It's under the MIT license.
If you don't have it yet and for some reason aren't using the submodule,

        git clone https://github.com/craigmj/json4lua lua/craigmj/json4lua
